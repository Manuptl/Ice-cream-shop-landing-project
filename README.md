# Ice-cream-shop-landing-project

 Languages used:- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Developed a fully responsive landing page for an ice-cream shop, optimizing for user experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
Utilized HTML5 to create a well-structured layout, including sections for shop introduction, product offerings, and customer reviews.
Designed the page's look and feel using CSS3, implementing custom animations, transitions, and a cohesive color scheme to create an engaging user interface.
Integrated JavaScript to add interactivity, such as a dynamic product carousel, smooth scrolling, and a contact form with validation.
Improved page loading speed by optimizing image assets and utilizing CSS for animations instead of heavier JavaScript libraries.
Ensured cross-browser compatibility and accessibility compliance (W3C standards).
